Running sitegenerator.py will generate an html from page_template.txt by replacing the indicated comments with the text from player1_template.txt and player2_template.txt. The output page will be named output_page.html. In our actual code we do not explicitly need to store parameter text like the text I am reading from player1_template.txt in a file. We can store that in a database or wherever else we'd like.
